# Medflect AI - Healthcare Intelligence Platform

## Overview

Medflect AI is a comprehensive healthcare platform that transforms hospital data into actionable clinical insights. The system is designed to address the critical healthcare workforce shortage in Ghana and across Africa, where there is approximately 1 doctor per 5,000 people. The platform leverages AI-powered clinical summaries, real-time analytics, and FHIR-compliant data interoperability to amplify clinician capabilities while maintaining patient consent through blockchain-based governance.

The application provides automated clinical summary generation, predictive risk alerts, hospital metrics monitoring, secure data sharing with consent management, and comprehensive data utilization capabilities. Built with offline-first architecture, it ensures functionality even with variable internet connectivity common in developing regions.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) using React 18 with Vite as the build tool. The UI framework utilizes shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS for styling. The application follows a component-driven architecture with TypeScript for type safety.

**Key Frontend Decisions:**
- **Offline-First Design**: Service Worker implementation for caching and offline functionality
- **PWA Capabilities**: Manifest configuration for installable app experience
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management with built-in caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **UI Framework**: Medical-themed design system with healthcare-specific color schemes

### Backend Architecture
The server uses Express.js with TypeScript in ESM format. The API follows RESTful conventions with specific routes for AI services, patient management, FHIR integration, and audit logging.

**Key Backend Decisions:**
- **Modular Service Architecture**: Separate services for Groq AI, FHIR, and storage operations
- **In-Memory Storage**: Current implementation uses memory storage with interface for future database integration
- **Middleware Pipeline**: Request logging, JSON parsing, and error handling middleware
- **Development Integration**: Vite middleware integration for seamless development experience

### Data Storage Solutions
The system uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect, structured with a comprehensive schema covering users, patients, clinical summaries, hospital metrics, risk alerts, and audit logs.

**Database Schema Design:**
- **User Management**: Role-based access (clinician, admin, patient) with department assignments
- **Patient Records**: FHIR-compliant patient data with MRN tracking and contact information
- **Clinical Summaries**: AI-generated summaries with metadata including generation time, model used, and status tracking
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging with blockchain hash integration for immutable records
- **Hospital Metrics**: Real-time operational metrics including bed occupancy and department loads

### Authentication and Authorization
The current implementation includes user roles (clinician, admin, patient) with department-based access controls. The system is designed to integrate with consent management through blockchain-based verification.

### AI Integration
The platform integrates with Groq's accelerated LLM infrastructure for clinical summary generation. The AI service supports multiple summary types (discharge, progress, handoff) with configurable models and performance tracking.

**AI Service Features:**
- **Model Flexibility**: Configurable Groq models (currently deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response time tracking and success rate metrics
- **Content Management**: Editable AI-generated content with status tracking
- **Context Awareness**: Patient data integration for personalized summaries
